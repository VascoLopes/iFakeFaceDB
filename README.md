[[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1911.05351) 

**iFakeFaceDB** is face image dataset for the study of synthetic face manipulation detection, comprising about **87,000** synthetic face images generated by the Style-GAN model [1] and transformed with the GANprintR approach. All images were aligned and resized to the size of **224 x 224**.
